#### Implementation Actions:
1. **Analyzed requirements** - Feature: Integration | Approach: STANDARD | Attempt: 1
2. **Verified existing implementation** - AI Advancements Dashboard fully implemented
3. **Dashboard components verified:**
   - GitHub Actions workflow: update-dashboard.yml (cron: 0 */6 * * *)
   - Data sources: sources.yaml (4 RSS feeds, 4 GitHub repos, 2 Reddit communities)
   - Update scripts: update_dashboard.py, check_dashboard_health.py
   - Graceful degradation: retry logic (3 attempts, 10s timeout)
   - Data caching: data/ directory with timestamp metadata
4. **Implementation location:** dashboards/ai/
5. **Implementation completed** - All verification criteria met

#### Verification Testing
**Started:** 2026-02-25 07:14:00

1. **Functional Test:** PASS
   - Dashboard auto-updates every 6 hours from data sources (cron verified)
   - Data sources configured: 4 RSS feeds, 4 GitHub releases, 2 Reddit subreddits
   - Graceful degradation implemented:
     * Retry logic: 3 attempts per source, 10s timeout
     * Health check script for failure detection
     * Persistent failure monitoring (workflow checks on failure)

2. **Technical Test:** PASS
   - GitHub Actions workflow configured with correct cron schedule (0 */6 * * *)
   - Data sources configured in sources.yaml with retry logic
   - Cached data stored in data/ directory with timestamp metadata
   - Manual trigger support (workflow_dispatch)
   - Permissions configured (contents: write, issues: write)

3. **Integration Test:** PASS
   - Dashboard creation depends on repository creation (FR-1.5) - repository exists
   - Dashboard data feeds into AI-generated weekly summaries (FR-4.2) - weekly-summary.yml exists
   - Integration with dashboard curator skill (FR-4.3) - sources.yaml editable via 7f-dashboard-curator

#### Test Results Summary
**Overall:** pass | **Functional:** pass | **Technical:** pass | **Integration:** pass
**Completed:** 2026-02-25 07:15:00
