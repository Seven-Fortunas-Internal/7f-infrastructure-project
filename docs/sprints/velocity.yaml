average_velocity: 35
velocity_trend: "baseline"
team_capacity: 42  # Maximum sustainable velocity
recommended_planning_velocity: 35  # Use for next sprint planning

# Velocity calculation formula:
# velocity = completed_points / (duration_days / 7)  # Normalize to weekly velocity
# For 2-week sprints: velocity = completed_points

# Completion rate formula:
# completion_rate = completed_points / planned_points
