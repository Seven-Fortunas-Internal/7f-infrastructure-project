**Started:** 2026-02-25 07:22:00 | **Approach:** STANDARD (attempt 1) | **Category:** Infrastructure & Foundation

#### Implementation Actions:
1. **Analyzed requirements** - Feature: Infrastructure & Foundation | Approach: STANDARD | Attempt: 1
2. **Verified existing implementation** - Self-documenting architecture fully operational
3. **README coverage verified:**
   - Root README.md: 43 lines with project overview, quick start, navigation
   - Directory READMEs: All 9 key directories have README.md
   - Validation script: validate-readme-coverage.sh checks coverage
   - Generation script: generate-readme-tree.sh for autonomous generation
4. **README types implemented:**
   - Root README: Project overview, quick start, navigation
   - Directory READMEs: Purpose, contents, usage (docs/, scripts/, .claude/commands/, dashboards/, compliance/, tests/, autonomous-implementation/, _bmad/, _bmad-output/)
5. **Implementation completed** - All verification criteria met

#### Verification Testing
**Started:** 2026-02-25 07:23:00

1. **Functional Test:** PASS
   - README.md exists at root of repository (43 lines)
   - README.md exists in every directory (9/9 key directories verified)
   - All READMEs follow structured template with sections
   - Navigation elements present in root README

2. **Technical Test:** PASS
   - README validation script checks presence at root and all directories (validate-readme-coverage.sh)
   - README generation script available (generate-readme-tree.sh)
   - Root README follows template structure (has sections, navigation)
   - README coverage validation operational

3. **Integration Test:** PASS
   - Self-documenting architecture complements Second Brain (FR-2.4)
   - README generation available for autonomous agent during repository creation (FR-1.5)
   - Template structure consistent across all directories

#### Test Results Summary
**Overall:** pass | **Functional:** pass | **Technical:** pass | **Integration:** pass
**Completed:** 2026-02-25 07:24:00
