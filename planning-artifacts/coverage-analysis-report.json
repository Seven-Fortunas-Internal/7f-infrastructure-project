    "✅ EXCELLENT COVERAGE: All 67 requirements (33 FRs + 34 NFRs) are fully covered with comprehensive feature specifications.",
    "✅ STRONG TRACEABILITY: Every PRD requirement maps 1:1 to app_spec.txt features with complete acceptance criteria, verification criteria (functional/technical/integration), dependencies, and constraints.",
    "✅ COMPREHENSIVE VERIFICATION: Each feature includes detailed verification criteria across three dimensions: functional (user-facing), technical (implementation quality), integration (system interactions).",
    "✅ AUTONOMOUS READINESS: app_spec.txt provides sufficient detail for autonomous agent implementation with 67 features, each having clear acceptance criteria, verification steps, and dependencies.",
    "✅ SECURITY EMPHASIS: Critical security requirements (FR-5.1, NFR-1.1, FR-1.4) have exceptional detail including specific metrics (≥99.5% detection rate), multi-layer defense strategies, and adversarial testing protocols.",
    "✅ PHASE CLARITY: Features clearly marked with phase (MVP-Day-0 through Phase-2) enabling phased implementation and prioritization.",
    "✅ TESTING STRATEGY: Comprehensive testing strategy section includes 5 test types (unit, integration, security, aha moment validation, performance), quality gates (pre-commit, PR, autonomous agent, MVP complete), and test data management.",
    "✅ DEPLOYMENT READINESS: Detailed deployment instructions with 4 phases (Day 0 foundation, Day 1-2 autonomous build, Day 3 human completion, Days 4-5 buffer), validation checkpoints, rollback strategy, and monitoring points.",
    "✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA: Quantified success criteria across feature completion (60-70% autonomous target), quality metrics (≥99.5% secret detection, 80% test coverage, zero critical failures), user validation (4 aha moments), performance (< 2s response time), and operational metrics (99% workflow reliability, <$10/month MVP cost).",
    "✅ REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION: Complete reference section with 8 internal documents, 7 external resources, and 10-term glossary providing autonomous agent with necessary context.",
    "⚠️ EXTENDED FEATURES: Two extended features (FEATURE_011_EXTENDED, FEATURE_012_EXTENDED) provide implementation details beyond base requirements. This is acceptable for autonomous implementation but should be documented as 'implementation detail' extensions of base FRs.",
    "⚠️ DUAL COVERAGE: Some NFRs are covered both as dedicated features (e.g., FEATURE_034 for NFR-1.1) AND in the non_functional_requirements section. This provides redundancy which is good for autonomous agents but should be clarified as intentional dual representation.",
    "✅ NO GAPS FOUND: Zero requirements are missing, partially covered, or inadequately specified. The coverage is complete and implementation-ready."
