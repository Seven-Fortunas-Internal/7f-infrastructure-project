# Product Brief: Seven Fortunas AI-Native Enterprise Infrastructure

**Project:** GitHub Organization, Second Brain & 7F Lens Intelligence Platform
**Date:** 2026-02-10
**Version:** 1.0
**Author:** Mary (Business Analyst Agent) with Jorge
**Status:** Draft - Ready for Stakeholder Review

---

## Executive Summary

Seven Fortunas is creating an **AI-native enterprise nervous system** - a living, intelligent infrastructure where company knowledge, culture, and operations exist as structured, AI-accessible data. This product brief defines the architecture, implementation strategy, and phased roadmap for:

1. **GitHub Organization Architecture** - Two-org model optimized for collaboration, security, and transparency
2. **Seven Fortunas Second Brain** - Progressive disclosure knowledge system accessible to AI agents and humans
3. **7F Lens Intelligence Platform** - Multi-dimensional dashboards tracking enterprise-critical vectors (AI advancements, fintech, security, opportunities)

**Unlike traditional organizations that retrofit AI onto static documents**, Seven Fortunas designs for AI from inception: every document, every repo, every standard is optimized for both human understanding and AI ingestion.

**Strategic Goals:**
- ✅ **Demonstrate AI-driven productivity** - Show leadership what's achievable with AI agents
- ✅ **Impress for funding** - Organized, professional, cutting-edge infrastructure
- ✅ **Enable mission** - Digital inclusion for marginalized communities powered by AI
- ✅ **Move at AI speed** - 60-70% of infrastructure built autonomously
- ✅ **Enable self-service** - Founding team configures infrastructure using BMAD skills (Jorge as enabler, not bottleneck)

**Timeline:** MVP in 1 week, Full platform in 3-6 months, Enterprise-ready in 12 months

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

**Primary Problem:** Startups struggle to establish professional, scalable infrastructure while moving fast with limited resources. Traditional approaches require choosing between:
- **Speed OR Quality** - Move fast but create technical debt, or build properly but move slowly
- **Manual OR Expensive** - DIY everything, or pay for enterprise tools/consultants
- **Closed OR Chaotic** - Keep everything private and miss transparency benefits, or open everything and lose control

**For Seven Fortunas specifically:**
- Leadership needs **impressive, organized infrastructure ASAP** for funding discussions
- Team needs **productivity tools** that leverage AI capabilities
- Mission requires **radical transparency** while maintaining security
- Limited budget demands **maximum ROI from every decision**

### Problem Impact

**Without This Solution:**
- ❌ Manual infrastructure setup takes 3-6 months (too slow for funding timeline)
- ❌ Disorganized GitHub presence hurts credibility with investors/partners
- ❌ Knowledge silos prevent AI agents from helping effectively
- ❌ No visibility into enterprise-critical trends (AI, fintech, security, opportunities)
- ❌ Team wastes time reinventing processes instead of building products

**Opportunity Cost:**
- Lost funding opportunities (unprofessional presentation)
- Lost productivity (team members can't find information)
- Lost insights (no intelligence gathering on competitive landscape)
- Lost momentum (manual setup delays product development)

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

**GitHub Organizations (Default Setup):**
- ❌ No guidance on structure (teams make arbitrary decisions)
- ❌ No intelligence gathering (just code hosting)
- ❌ No AI optimization (static, unstructured content)
- ❌ No knowledge management (docs scattered everywhere)

**Enterprise Knowledge Bases (Notion, Confluence):**
- ❌ Not AI-accessible (paywalled, no APIs, or poor structure)
- ❌ Separate from code (context split across tools)
- ❌ Expensive ($10-20/user/month minimum)
- ❌ Not designed for progressive disclosure

**Business Intelligence Tools (Tableau, Looker):**
- ❌ Expensive ($70-100+/user/month)
- ❌ Requires data warehouse (additional complexity)
- ❌ Not real-time intelligence gathering
- ❌ Overkill for startup needs

### Proposed Solution

**Seven Fortunas AI-Native Enterprise Infrastructure** combines three integrated systems:

#### 1. GitHub Organization Architecture
**Two-org model** with team-based structure:
- `Seven-Fortunas-Internal` (Private) - Development, operations, proprietary work
- `Seven-Fortunas` (Public) - Open-source, showcases, thought leadership

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Clear security boundary (internal vs. public)
- ✅ Enables cross-functional collaboration (teams, not orgs per function)
- ✅ Follows GitHub best practices (minimize organizations)
- ✅ Free tier → Enterprise tier migration path
- ✅ Impressive for investors (organized, professional)

#### 2. Seven Fortunas Second Brain
**Progressive disclosure knowledge system** where information is loaded just-in-time:
- Brand identity (colors, fonts, voice, philosophy)
- Company culture (ethos, values, decision frameworks)
- Domain expertise (tokenization, education, compliance, security)
- Best practices (engineering, security, operations)
- Custom skills (AI-generated content using 7F context)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ AI agents reference company DNA automatically
- ✅ Consistent voice across all content
- ✅ Onboarding accelerated (new team members get context)
- ✅ Scalable (grows without overwhelming users)
- ✅ Obsidian-compatible (visualization, mobile access)

#### 3. 7F Lens Intelligence Platform
**Multi-dimensional dashboards** tracking enterprise-critical vectors:
- 🤖 **AI Advancements** (models, research, tools, regulations) - **MVP FOCUS**
- 💰 **Fintech Trends** (payments, tokenization, DeFi, regulations)
- 🎓 **Education Technology** (EduPeru market, competitors, innovations)
- 🔒 **Security Intelligence** (threats, compliance, best practices)
- 📈 **Investment & Opportunities** (funding, partnerships, market signals)
- 🏢 **Productivity Metrics** (team velocity, tool adoption, efficiency)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Real-time intelligence (updated every 6 hours)
- ✅ Stakeholder-specific views (engineers, execs, investors)
- ✅ Internal + public versions (full intelligence + curated showcase)
- ✅ AI-powered insights (Claude summarizes weekly trends)
- ✅ GitHub as delivery medium (no separate tools needed)

**Progressive Disclosure:**
- AI agents load `index.md` first (table of contents)
- Load specific sections as needed (just-in-time)
- Metadata in frontmatter (tags, category, audience)
- Obsidian-compatible (can visualize graph, edit on mobile)

---

## API Key Strategy

### Phase 1 (MVP): Personal API Keys

**Approach:** Leverage individual team members' personal API accounts with authorization

| Service | Owner | Account Type | Cost | Migration Timeline |
|---------|-------|--------------|------|-------------------|
| X API | Henry (CEO) | Personal paid | $100/month | Post-funding (Month 3-6) |
| Claude API | Jorge or team | Personal | ~$5/month | Post-funding (Month 3-6) |
| GitHub API | Seven-Fortunas org | Organizational | Free | N/A (already corporate) |

**Requirements:**
- Written authorization from account owner
- API key registry document (`docs/api-key-registry.md`)
- Usage monitoring (owner tracks billing)
- GitHub Secret naming: `X_API_BEARER_TOKEN_HENRY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_JORGE`

### Phase 2 (Post-Funding): Corporate API Keys

**Trigger Events:**
- Series A funding closes
- Team grows beyond 20 people
- Enterprise sales conversations begin

**Migration Steps:**
1. Create Anthropic organizational account
2. Create X Business/Enterprise account
3. Generate new API keys (corporate)
4. Add to GitHub Secrets with `_CORPORATE` suffix
5. Update workflows to use new keys
6. Deactivate personal keys
7. Update registry

---

## Constraints & Trade-offs

### Budget Constraints

**Phase 1 (MVP):**
- **Constraint:** Zero budget for tools/services
- **Solution:** GitHub Free tier + personal API keys
- **Trade-off:** Limited to 2,000 Actions minutes/month (use public repos for unlimited)
- **Mitigation:** Optimize workflow efficiency, use public repos where possible

**Phase 2:**
- **Constraint:** Startup budget (~$100-200/month for tools)
- **Solution:** GitHub Free tier, minimal API usage
- **Trade-off:** Can't use advanced GitHub features (CODEOWNERS enforcement, etc.)
- **Mitigation:** Document policies even if not technically enforced

**Phase 3:**
- **Constraint:** Need SOC2 for enterprise sales, requires GitHub Enterprise
- **Solution:** Budget $1,200-2,300/month post-funding
- **Trade-off:** Significant monthly cost
- **Mitigation:** This is ROI-positive (enables $50k+ enterprise deals)

### Timeline Constraints

**Phase 1:**
- **Constraint:** Leadership wants impressive demo ASAP (1 week)
- **Solution:** Autonomous coding agent + BMAD skills
- **Trade-off:** May not be 100% polished
- **Mitigation:** "Built in 3 days with AI" IS the impressive part

### Technical Constraints

**GitHub Free Tier:**
- **No CODEOWNERS enforcement** → Document policy, enforce in code review
- **No required reviewers** → Honor system + culture
- **No draft PRs** → Use `[WIP]` prefix in PR title
- **Limited Actions minutes (private repos)** → Use public repos for dashboards

**Personal API Keys:**
- **Usage attributed to individual** → Monitor and migrate post-funding
- **Owner can revoke** → Have backup plan, transition to corporate quickly

### Skill Constraints

**Team Availability:**
- **Constraint:** Founding team is small (5-10 people), everyone is busy
- **Solution:** AI agents do 60-80% of work
- **Trade-off:** Still need human curation (20-40%)
- **Mitigation:** Batch curation work (daily review sessions, not constant)

---

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

**Risk 1: Autonomous Agent Produces Low-Quality Output**
- **Likelihood:** Medium
- **Impact:** Medium (delays MVP by 1-2 days)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Human reviews agent output daily
  - Clear feature specification (good `app_spec.txt`)
  - Can fall back to manual scaffolding if needed

**Risk 2: GitHub Actions Quota Exceeded**
- **Likelihood:** Low (2,000 minutes/month is generous for MVP)
- **Impact:** Low (dashboards stop updating temporarily)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Use public repos (unlimited Actions)
  - Optimize workflow efficiency
  - Reduce update frequency if needed (6h → 12h)

**Risk 3: API Keys Revoked/Rate Limited**
- **Likelihood:** Low
- **Impact:** Medium (specific dashboard stops working)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Conditional features (gracefully degrade if API unavailable)
  - Multiple data sources (Reddit, YouTube RSS don't need keys)
  - Quick migration to corporate accounts if personal keys revoked

### Business Risks

**Risk 4: Leadership Unimpressed by MVP**
- **Likelihood:** Low (they've given mandate, understand AI approach)
- **Impact:** High (lose momentum, funding timeline jeopardized)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Set clear expectations (MVP is foundation, not final product)
  - Emphasize "built in 3 days with AI" narrative
  - Have Phase 2 roadmap ready (show what's coming)

**Risk 5: Team Doesn't Adopt Infrastructure**
- **Likelihood:** Medium (change management is hard)
- **Impact:** High (infrastructure unused = wasted effort)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Involve team in Phase 2 (co-creation, not top-down)
  - Make it obviously better than status quo (easier, faster)
  - Train team on usage (onboarding sessions)
  - Get founding team buy-in first (they model behavior)

### Compliance Risks

**Risk 6: SOC2 Timeline Misaligned with Sales**
- **Likelihood:** Medium (enterprise sales may come before SOC2 complete)
- **Impact:** High (can't close enterprise deals without SOC2)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Start SOC2 process 6 months before anticipated need
  - Target mid-market first (often don't require SOC2)
  - Use GitHub Enterprise features as "SOC2-ready" signal
