## Key Content Summary

### Executive Summary (Lines 22-40)
**Vision:** AI-native enterprise nervous system where knowledge, culture, operations exist as structured AI-accessible data

**Three Integrated Systems:**
1. GitHub Organization Architecture (two-org model)
2. Seven Fortunas Second Brain (progressive disclosure knowledge)
3. 7F Lens Intelligence Platform (multi-dimensional dashboards)

**Strategic Goals:**
- Demonstrate AI-driven productivity
- Impress for funding
- Enable mission (digital inclusion)
- Move at AI speed (60-70% autonomous)
- Enable self-service (Jorge as enabler, not bottleneck)

**Timeline:** MVP 1 week, Full platform 3-6 months, Enterprise-ready 12 months

---

### Problem Statement (Lines 45-72)
**Primary Problem:** Startups must choose between Speed OR Quality, Manual OR Expensive, Closed OR Chaotic

**For Seven Fortunas:**
- Leadership needs impressive infrastructure ASAP for funding
- Team needs productivity tools leveraging AI
- Mission requires radical transparency + security
- Limited budget demands maximum ROI

**Without Solution:**
- 3-6 months manual setup (too slow)
- Disorganized GitHub hurts credibility
- Knowledge silos prevent AI help
- No visibility into trends
- Wasted time reinventing processes

---

### Proposed Solution (Lines 93-184)
**Three Systems:**

**1. GitHub Organization Architecture**
- Two-org model: Seven-Fortunas (public), Seven-Fortunas-Internal (private)
- Benefits: Clear security boundary, cross-functional collaboration, GitHub best practices, migration path to Enterprise

**2. Seven Fortunas Second Brain**
- Progressive disclosure: brand, culture, domain expertise, best practices, custom skills
- Benefits: AI agents reference company DNA, consistent voice, accelerated onboarding, scalable, Obsidian-compatible

**3. 7F Lens Intelligence Platform**
- Dashboards: AI Advancements (MVP), Fintech, EduTech, Security, Investment, Productivity (Phase 2+)
- Benefits: Real-time intelligence, stakeholder views, internal + public versions, AI insights, GitHub delivery

**Key Differentiators:**
1. AI-First Design (not retrofit)
2. Radical Transparency with Security Boundaries
3. Mission-Driven Unfair Advantage
4. Autonomous AI Execution (60-70% in 5 days vs 3-6 months)
5. Self-Service Infrastructure (enabler not bottleneck)

### Technical Architecture (Lines 762-880)
**GitHub Organization Structure:** Diagram showing two-org model with Private Mirrors App

**7F Lens Dashboard Architecture:** Data sources → Aggregation (GitHub Actions) → AI Processing (Claude API) → Display (GitHub Pages)

**Second Brain Architecture:** Directory structure (brand, culture, domain-expertise, best-practices, skills) with progressive disclosure

---

### API Key Strategy (Lines 889-923)
**Phase 1 (MVP):** Personal API keys with authorization
- X API: Henry (personal paid, $100/month)
- Claude API: Jorge/team (personal, $5/month)
- GitHub API: Seven-Fortunas org (Free)

**Phase 2 (Post-Funding):** Corporate API keys
- Trigger: Series A closes, team >20, enterprise sales
- Migration: Create corporate accounts, update secrets, deactivate personal

---

### Constraints & Trade-offs (Lines 925-975)
**Budget Constraints:**
- MVP: $0 budget, GitHub Free tier
- Phase 2: $100-200/month
- Phase 3: $1,200-2,300/month (Enterprise + APIs + SOC2 audit)

**Timeline Constraints:**
- Leadership wants demo ASAP (1 week)
- Solution: Autonomous agent + BMAD skills

**Technical Constraints:**
- GitHub Free tier: No CODEOWNERS enforcement, no required reviewers, no draft PRs, limited Actions minutes
- Mitigation: Document policies, honor system, use public repos for dashboards

---

### Risk Assessment (Lines 977-1033)
**Technical Risks:**
- Autonomous agent low-quality output (Medium/Medium) → Daily review, fall back to manual
- GitHub Actions quota exceeded (Low/Low) → Use public repos, optimize
- API keys revoked (Low/Medium) → Conditional features, multiple sources

**Business Risks:**
- Leadership unimpressed (Low/High) → Set expectations, emphasize "built in 3 days"
- Team doesn't adopt (Medium/High) → Involve in Phase 2, obviously better

**Compliance Risks:**
- SOC2 timeline misaligned (Medium/High) → Start 6 months early, target mid-market first

---
