## Critical Corrections to Apply

### Buck (VP Engineering) Role Corrections
**Incorrect (from UX spec/PRD):**
- ❌ Security Testing journey (pre-commit hooks, bypass attempts, encoded secrets)
- ❌ Aha moment: "Security on Autopilot"
- ❌ Compliance responsibilities

**Correct (per Jorge's guidance):**
- ✅ Engineering delivery focus (apps, backend, product development)
- ✅ Application security (app-level: authentication, API security, PCI compliance)
- ✅ Aha moment: Engineering infrastructure supports rapid development, team can ship fast
- ✅ User journey: Deploy microservice, setup CI/CD, configure app-level security, test deployment

### Jorge (VP AI-SecOps) Role Corrections
**Add to Jorge's responsibilities:**
- ✅ Security Testing journey (adversarial testing of infrastructure security controls)
- ✅ Compliance (SOC 2, GDPR, audit requirements)
- ✅ Security Operations (SecOps) infrastructure

**Clarify distinction:**
- **Jorge = SecOps:** Infrastructure security (secret scanning, Dependabot, audit logs, security testing)
- **Buck = App Security:** Application-level security (API auth, rate limiting, PCI for apps)
