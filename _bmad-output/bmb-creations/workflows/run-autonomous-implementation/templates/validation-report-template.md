## Circuit Breaker Validation (Logic Consistency)

**Result:** CB_RESULT

**Checks:** CB_TOTAL
- Passed: CB_PASSED
- Failed: CB_FAILED
- Warnings: CB_WARNINGS

### What Was Validated

1. **Threshold Range** - Valid range (1-99), recommended range (3-10)
2. **Consecutive Failures Range** - Non-negative, within bounds
3. **Status Consistency** - Status matches consecutive_failures vs threshold
4. **Status Value** - Status is valid enum
5. **Session Count** - Non-negative, consistent with progress
6. **Last Session Success Tracking** - Consistent with consecutive_failures
7. **Circuit Breaker Trigger Logic** - Trigger conditions correct

### Circuit Breaker State

- Session Count: SESSION_COUNT
- Consecutive Failures: CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES
- Threshold: THRESHOLD
- Status: CB_STATUS
