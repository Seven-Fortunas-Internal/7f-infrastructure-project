  <overview>
    <executive_summary>
      Seven Fortunas is an AI-native digital inclusion platform building the future of accessible fintech and edutech.
      This project establishes the foundational GitHub infrastructure, knowledge management systems, and automation
      workflows to enable rapid autonomous development.

      The infrastructure leverages BMAD (Business Method Autonomous Development) methodology for workflow-driven
      development with 26 operational skills (18 BMAD adopted + 8 custom). The system includes a progressive disclosure
      Second Brain for organizational knowledge, 7F Lens intelligence platform for AI/fintech/edutech tracking, and
      comprehensive security controls targeting SOC 2 compliance.

      Key innovation: 87% reduction in development effort by adopting existing BMAD workflows versus building custom
      solutions.

Retry in 6 hours." — blank/empty dashboard is NOT acceptable), data 0–7 days stale (warning banner with timestamp), data older than 7 days (error page — do not render dashboard), Claude API failure (skip summaries, display raw data), persistent failures greater than 24h (GitHub Issue auto-created)
