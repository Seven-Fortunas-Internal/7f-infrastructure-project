#### Implementation Actions:
1. **Analyzed requirements** - Feature: Business Logic | Approach: STANDARD | Attempt: 1
2. **Verified existing implementation** - Skill governance system fully operational
3. **Governance components verified:**
   - SKILL-GOVERNANCE.md: Complete governance documentation (12KB)
   - track-skill-usage.sh: Logs skill invocations with timestamps
   - analyze-skill-usage.sh: Generates usage reports and consolidation recommendations
   - 7f-skill-creator: Built-in search-before-create functionality (4-step Skill Search)
4. **Governance features:**
   - Search before create (prevents duplicates)
   - Usage tracking (logs invocations)
   - Quarterly reviews (90-day cycle)
   - Consolidation recommendations (similar skills)
   - Deprecation process (stale/unused skills)
5. **Implementation completed** - All verification criteria met

#### Verification Testing
**Started:** 2026-02-25 07:26:00

1. **Functional Test:** PASS
   - 7f-skill-creator searches existing skills before creating (Duplicate Prevention + 4-step Skill Search)
   - Usage tracking operational (track-skill-usage.sh + analyze-skill-usage.sh)
   - Quarterly review process documented in SKILL-GOVERNANCE.md:
     * 90-day review cycle
     * Deprecation criteria (180 days unused, stale Tier 3)
     * Consolidation process for similar skills

2. **Technical Test:** PASS
   - Skill search uses keyword/similarity matching (searches skills-registry.yaml)
   - Usage tracking logs skill invocations with timestamp format
   - Consolidation recommendations generated automatically:
     * Detects similar skill names
     * Identifies overlapping functionality
     * Provides merge criteria

3. **Integration Test:** PASS
   - Skill governance integrates with skill organization system (FR-3.3)
   - Uses skills-registry.yaml for tier assignments
   - Governance metrics tracked:
     * Top 10 most used skills
     * Unused skills
     * Stale skills (90+ days)
     * Consolidation candidates

#### Test Results Summary
**Overall:** pass | **Functional:** pass | **Technical:** pass | **Integration:** pass
