# BMAD Version Lock
# This file pins the BMAD library version installed in _bmad/
#
# BMAD is installed via npx (not a git submodule) because the npm package
# applies project-specific configuration during install. The upstream GitHub
# repo (bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD) uses a src/ build structure that differs
# from the installed _bmad/ output; a direct submodule is not compatible.
#
# To update BMAD, see docs/bmad-update-policy.md
